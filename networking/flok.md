# Flok

Web-based P2P collaborative editor for live coding music and graphics made by the argentinean programmer munshkr.



It can interpret many live-codoing apps as TidalCycles, FoxDot, Mercury and more general as SuperCollider.&#x20;

The only app not needed to install locally is Hydra.

You need to press **⌘+⌅** to render instead of the hydra's ⌃+⇧+⌅

{% hint style="warning" %}
WARNING - Please Read: Using a public server can be dangerous as anyone can execute code on your computer via Flok, so please make sure you only share your session URL to trusted users and friends when you use a public server. I will not be held responsible for any damaged caused by Flok. You have been warned. There is an issue assigned to mitigate this security problem.
{% endhint %}

Two public servers known nowadays are:

[flok.clic.cf ](http://flok.clic.cf)

[flok-hub.herokuapp.com](http:flok-hub.herokuapp.com)



**Hydra**

Hydra is already included in the web App. You don't need to install anything as it runs on the browser. Just use the `hydra` target to execute Hydra code.

If you want to use the screen capturing feature, you will need to install a specific [Chrome extension](https://github.com/munshkr/flok-hydra-chrome-extension) for Flok, that gives permissions to capture the desktop screen from within the current public servers.

Read [more](https://github.com/munshkr/flok-hydra-chrome-extension/blob/master/README.md) on how to install the extension.
