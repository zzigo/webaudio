# js-variables



1. Variables in JS are untype

```jsx
// Values can be assigned to variables with an = sign 

x = 0; // Now the variable x has the value 0
x.  // => 0: A variable evaluates to its value

// JavaScript supports several types of values 

x = 1; // Numbers.
x = 0.01; // Numbers can be integers or reals.
x = "hello world"; // Strings of text in quotation marks.
x = 'JavaScript'; // Single quote marks also delimit strings.
x = true; // A Boolean value.
x = false; // The other Boolean value.
x = null; // Null is a special value that means "no value."
x = undefined; // Undefined is another special value like null. 
```

Since the update ES6 (2015) there are new features to declare variables. We have the new options `let` and `const`, added to the old `var`

Each of its specificities will be defined by its scope, use, and hoisting.

#### One Statement, Many Variables

You can declare many variables in one statement.

```jsx
var person = "John Doe", carName = "Volvo", price = 200;
```

#### var

What is a scope?

Scope means where these variables are available for use. **var** declarations area globally scoped or function/locally scoped.

* global: when a **var** is declared outside a function. So, when a var is declared outside a function (or a block) is available for use in the whole window.

```jsx
var tonality = "C Major" ;

function section1() {
	var modulation = "Eb Major";
}
```

Here, `tonality` is globally scoped because it exits outside a function while `modulation` is function scoped. So we cannot access the variable `modulation` outside of a function .

*   var variables can be re-declared and updated

    ```jsx
    var tonality = "C Major";
    var tonality = "Gb Major";

    or

    var tonality = "C Major";
    tonality = "Gb Major";
    ```

#### Hoisting

Is a JavaScript mechanism where variables and functions declarations are moved to the top of their scope before code execution. This means that if we do this:

```jsx
console.log (tonality);
var tonality = "C Major"; 
```

it is interpreted as this:

```jsx
var tonality;
console.log (tonality); // still undefined
tonality = "C Major";
```

#### let

\<aside> ⭕ Variables defined with `let` cannot be Redeclared.

Variables defined with `let` must be Declared before use.

Variables defined with `let` have Block Scope.

\</aside>

Is now preferred for variable declaration. Its an improvement to `var` declarations and solve many problems.

*   `let` is block scoped

    * A block is a chunk of code bounded by {}. A block lives in curly braces: function, for, while, if..then..else, switch case, arrays.
    * A variable declared in a block with `let` is only available for use within that block.

    ```jsx
    let greeting = "say Hi";
       let times = 4;

       if (times > 3) {
            let hello = "say Hello instead";
            console.log(hello);// "say Hello instead"
        }
       console.log(hello) // hello is not defined
    	
    if {
    }

    for {

    }
    ```

We see that using `hello` outside its block (the curly braces where it was defined) returns an error. This is because `let` variables are block-scoped.

**let can be updated but not re-declared.**

Just like `var`, a variable declared with `let` can be updated within its scope. Unlike `var`, a `let` variable cannot be re-declared within its scope. So while this will work:

```jsx
let greeting = "say Hi";
    greeting = "say Hello instead";
```

this will return an error:

```jsx
let greeting = "say Hi";
    let greeting = "say Hello instead"; // error: Identifier 'greeting' has already been declared
```

#### const

\<aside> ⭕ Variables defined with `const` cannot be Redeclared.

Variables defined with `const` cannot be Reassigned.

Variables defined with `const` have Block Scope.

\</aside>

```jsx
const PI = 3.141592653589793;
PI = 3.14;      // This will give an error
PI = PI + 10;   // This will also give an error
```

Variables declared with the `const` maintain constant values. `const` declarations share some similarities with `let` declarations.

*   **const declarations are block-scoped**

    Like `let` declarations, `const` declarations can only be accessed within the block they were declared.
*   **const cannot be updated or re-declared**

    This means that the value of a variable declared with `const` remains the same within its scope. It cannot be updated or re-declared. So if we declare a variable with `const`, we can neither do this:

    ```jsx
        const greeting = "say Hi";
        greeting = "say Hello instead";// error: Assignment to constant variable.
    ```

    nor this:

    ```jsx
        const greeting = "say Hi";
        const greeting = "say Hello instead";// error: Identifier 'gre
    ```

    Every `const` declaration, therefore, must be initialized at the time of declaration.

    This behavior is somehow different when it comes to objects declared with `const`. While a `const` object cannot be updated, the properties of this object can be updated. Therefore, if we declare a `const` object like this:

    ```jsx
        const greeting = {
            message: "say Hi",
            times: 4
        }
    ```

    while we cannot do this:

    ```jsx
        greeting = {
            words: "Hello",
            number: "five"
        } // error:  Assignment to constant variable.
    ```

    we can do this:

    ```jsx
        greeting.message = "say Hello instead";
    ```

    This will update the value of `greeting.message` without returning errors.

#### **Hoisting of const**

* Just like `let`, `const` declarations are hoisted to the top but are not initialized.
* So just in case, you missed the differences, here they are:
* `varletconstvarletconst`They are all hoisted to the top of their scope. But while variables are initialized with, and variables are not initialized. While and can be declared without being initialized, must be initialized during declaration.
