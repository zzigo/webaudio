# IA & ML



## What is Machine Learning?

> The field of machine learning is concerned with the question of how to construct computer programs that automatically improve with experience. T./ Mitchell, 1997, Machine Learning

1. ML is a subset of IA
2. Lets go for an example, imagine that you want to write a program to reconigze an isorritmitc motet from a a choral or a 19th vocal piece.
3. If you want to write this program using traditional programming techniques, your program is goint to get overly complex. You will have to come up with lots of rules to come up with specific curves, rules and exceptions to these rules, pitch classes, rhytmical patterns , lyric parsers an comparers to tell if it’s a composition from XVI or XIX century. But then If I give you , just one voice of the four or more, your program would not work and you would have to rewrite it.
4. To solve the this type of problems we use ML.
5. In ML we build a model or an engine and give it lots and lots of data.
6. For example we give it thousands or ten of thousands of recordings of motets and vocal music. Or even better , midi files.
7. Our model will then find and learn patterns and the input data, so we can give it a new score of any style that even wasn’t in the database, and ask it, is it a motet or is a lied or what kind of technique is using. And it will tell us with a certain level of accuracy the more input data we give it, the more accurate our model is going to be.
8. There is a lot of phantasy but also political, social, economical, moral, and ethical implications of saying that a program learns.
9. The first axiom of ML is : the performance of a programme improves as experience grows.
10. Experience here means data, in quantity and in quality ← Datacentric IA. A lot of very good data.
11. So the our first task is to learn how to build a good data-set or collection in three stages: to collect, handle, and process.
