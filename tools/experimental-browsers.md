# Experimental Browsers

#### Brave

Founded by the javascript creator and Mozllla founder Brian Eich in a pragmatical application on the economy of attention: the BAT (Basic Attention Token). Basically, this browser based on chromium bans blocks online ads and replaces them for its own ads environment,  paying fees to the users in exchange for their attention.&#x20;
