# ▪ Welcome to WA-HEM

## [HEM WebAudio](https://github.com/zzigo/webaudio)

## Description

Can we understand the Internet as one of the major tasks that our generation must interpret, shape, and re-discover?

From studying the historical-societal and cultural environment of its foundation until the last implemented technologies on the browser, this class will focus on the creation of online instruments and art-pieces.

We'll exploring topics ranging from the philosophical basis of networked logic to more advanced coding of web-audio generators, interfaces and ML/IA algorithms. Examples will be demonstrated using js-html code editors (both online and offline), with a focus on musical aesthetics.

## Presentations

Each student is required to make a personal repository on gitpod, repl.it, or github ,where all the class can access and share each other's projects. Also, students can propose a research presentation once during the course. The format for the presentations is quite open. They could be focused on performatic, instructional, theoretical or conceptual aspects of the materials presented in previous classes. You should include a link to documentation of your talk on the participatory webaudio-wiki.
