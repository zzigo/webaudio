# Metaverse's introduction



* The term comes straight out of Neal Stephenson's 1980s novel Snowcrash. It is a cousin of William Gibson's term cyberspace, which became relatively important in the 1990s with the internet, although it was not used commercially.
* The term tries to define a transversal virtual reality platform where economy and leisure can be combined. Similar to what is seen in films like 'Ready Player One' (and its original book and many other CF books).
* Is not a new idea, you may remember Second Life. But with each iteration more solid attributes and technical possibilities are added. In this opportunity the new ones are blockchain and VR.
* It is an environment in which things are not what they are, but what they seem. But whose fiction has the limit of real dollars. The generation of 'virtualised and virtualising virtual economies' whose application is on platforms similar to video games.
* Between the tokenized games, three are those which have more possibilities to grow:

#### upland

* buying lands and properties tied to real world

#### decentraland

#### the sandbox

#### Roblox

* Other platforms more focused on entertainment, in Lua allows users to create their own video games.



* It was created in 2004-06 by Erik Cassell and David Baszucki originally called DynaBlocks.
* Rec Room
* Is it imaginable to deal with a dollarized, tokenized economy that is supported by a video game? Such a scenario is feasible and, even if the 'Metaverse' is not exactly realized, the vectors of development have a definite orientation. The 'gamification' of the economy and the Real World is a project.

&#x20;FLE are events that occur within the match that connects to the [story line](https://fortnite.fandom.com/wiki/Lore\_\(Battle\_Royale\)) of Fortnite. They usually occur in the middle or near the end of the season. Some events involve turning off shooting, so everyone can enjoy the event. Sometimes, build is still enabled, so players can build up and get a better view. 4/23/2020 - Travis Scott.
