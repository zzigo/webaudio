# introduction to GUI

The Graphic User Interface is the invention that allowed computers to become more humans. In the most essential way, there is an icon that represents a folder, a file, or a program, and an arrow representing the user interaction. In this sense, is the opposite to the CLI paradigm (Command Line Interface).

Today, the GUI is redefined by the diversity of platforms where a webpage is displayed, by one side, and the multiplicity of input and interaction interfaces: mouse, keyboard, touch screens, microphones, accelerometers, gyroscopes, and cameras. The last will be covered in the group called [**Interfaces**](broken-reference/)**.**

We say that an application or webpage is responsive when it is prepared to be visualized in any format (landscape-portrait-resize) and device.

To know how to deal with responsive design in CSS go to the sections [**Viewport**](../css/viewport.md), [**Media queries**](../css/media-queries.md), [**Flexbox**](../css/flexbox.md) and [**Grid**](../css/grid.md).\
In HTML, you will learn what is a [**Canvas**](../html/canvas.md) and **WebGL** modes.

Finally in Javascript, refer to the **Window object**, and **innerWindow** properties in P5.
