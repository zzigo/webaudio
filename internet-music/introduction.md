# Introduction



Only 30 years have passed since the process of dematerialization, ubiquity and digitization started in 1991 right here in Geneva by Tim Berners-Lee. Let us also remember that the primary impetus for the creation of the DARPA network (Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency, 1958) was fear, defense, and the conquest of outer space. And a response to the launch of the Sputnik satellite by the USSR (1957). Among the technologists and thinkers who designed the Internet, a series of common principles emerge that order the steps to follow:

1. On-going programs that seek to improve man-machine interaction in teaching and learning. (Joseph "Lick" Licklider, 1962)
2. The thinking of Paul Baran (1964), The distributed communications is the best system over the centralized and decentralized.
3. The need of the Standard Message Block: is a block that presents a common carrier communications network, by digital transmission, independent of its channel type (by the time, tv stations, satellites, variable data rate links, and users), this will give rise to the concept of packet switching.

From a cognitive, linguistic, and aesthetic point of view, there is a revolutionary shift between the emergence of the alphabet (-3500 AD) and the conformation of a synthetic-image language:

1. Mythical thought gives away to Historical-Critical thinking because the structure of linear writing is a uni-dimensional, uni-directed line. So people started to think historically in a causal way, and in a critical way.
2. The emergence of internet language gives away to a disruption into points, where discourse has been substituted by calculus or a systemic or structural way of thinking.
   1. MMM LANGUAGE (PREHISTORIC WAY OF THINKING) → ALPHABET (HISTORICAL CONSCIOUSNESS) → INTERNET (POST-HISTORICAL STRUCTURAL WAY OF THINKING).
      1. In the greek-Jewish traditional framework where images are being accepted with distrust or only as a copy of the realm, the internet introduces a protocol where images no longer represent the world but are articulations of thoughts. They are models, projections, or resonant signs (a sign with the McLuhman's tetradic function).

#### how can we interpret the internet today?

* As a highly complex artificial being with a mostly unknown nature.
* A task of our age is to use, shape, and discover (interpret and create) the internet.
* '60→ interconnected universities '80→world connected '90 www '00 → social network '10 → IOT
* 1995 mp3, 2000 peer-to-peer technologies, 2005 streaming, 2008 blockchain.
* In the second decade of XXI, Internet can be understood as a complex being formed from five kinds of intertwined coexisting networks: the net, the web, the social networks, the IoT, and the sharing networks(file sharing, blockchain, and distributed-apps)
* Identifying and lo shaping influences of certain social and cultural relationships on the formation of the internet makes it easier for us to consider and identify the opposite relationships (i.e. to study the social and cultural impacts of internet use)
* Understanding the social construction of the internet can help us understand the social and cultural impact of its use. _(The social construction of technology: SCOT, proposed by Bijker and Pinch ( The Social Constructions of Facts and Artefacts: Or How the Sociology of Science and the Sociology of Technology Might Benefit Each Other)._
* Some characteristics:
  * The mode of Internet use changes very quickly and unpredictably.
    * Internet is ubiquitous or omnipresent. This makes it almost impossible to define the Internet as a research object, due to its highly complex organization of complex entities. _(Barabasi, Linked: The New Science of Networks; Pastor-Satorras and Vespignani, Evolution and Structure of the Internet)_
  * The users of the internet are not passive acceptors, but they are active agents. _(Feenberg and Friesen, (Re) Inventing the Internet, and the so-called " user research", Oudshoorn and Pinch, How Users Maters. I_n other words, constructor and user roles typically interlock with each other.
  * The emergence and deployment of the internet are synchronic with the late modern or postmodern age in a parallel trajectory with becoming widespread and achieving a cultural dominancy of the postmodern values and ideology.
  * ubiquity across devices and operating systems.
  * the user-centered security model and the fact that neither its specification nor its implementation is controlled by a single company makes the web a unique platform to develop software on.
  * inherent likability, it's possible to search it and share what you've found with anyone, anywhere.
