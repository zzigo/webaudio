# On-Screen console

&#x20;When you load an HTML page, the browser creates a document object (the first hierarchy of the DOM). The **document** object is the root node of the HTML document.

Having the element paragraph \<p>with an **id** "console" we want to change its content.&#x20;

We can access  the element _**p**_ with the document method `.getElementById("name")`&#x20;

And then accesing to any property of the given element, in this case, the one called `.innerHTML` that lets us get or set the HTML content of the object.
