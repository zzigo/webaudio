# Intro to networked performance

Since few decades,  networked performance music can be considered as a bunch of innovative musical actions enabled by technology.

> A Networked Music Performance occurs when a group of musicians, located at different physical locations, interact over a network to perform as if they would, if located in the same room. (Lazzaro J & Wawzynel J ,2001)

On this historical definition, there is a bias that sees the network as a surrogate for the natural propagation of sound and light.&#x20;

Then, in order to establish certain typologies, we can arrive at a broader definition such as:

> the practice of conducting real-time music interaction over a computer network.&#x20;

In a very close interrelationship, technological limitations become aesthetic resources. For example the range of times stablished by LAN or WAN networks, from the tightly to the loosely synchronicity can be compared with the harmonic and articulation implications between an arpeggio and a chord.

This is inherent to the evolution of flow programming languages dedicated to music. In the case of MaxMSP where MIDI control (1987), an information in the RIA range (Realistic Interaction Approach) precedes the MSP (Max Signal Processing, 1990-1997), usually a signal in the LAA range (Latency Accepting Approach). In other words, latency becomes a musical parameter.

Try this!&#x20;

1. open the terminal
2. type traceroute 192.205.33.93 or any web address (withouth http :// or https://)



`traceroute` `<ip or webaddress>` is a command to trace the hops between your computer and a final destination.

Each line lists the hop number, three measurements for Round Trip Time (RTT), the system Name and IP Address reached at that hop.
{% endhint %}

\
**Round Trip Time (RTT):** The time it takes for a packet to get to a hop and back, displayed in milliseconds (ms). By default, **tracert** sends three packets to each hop, so the output lists three roundtrip times per hop. RTT is sometimes also referred to as latency. An important factor that may impact RTT is the physical distance between hops.\
\
If an asterisk (\*) appears for RTT, then a packet was not returned within the expected timeframe.
