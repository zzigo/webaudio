# coding basics

{% hint style="info" %}
computer code is full of acronyms. To access to a full list of them go to the \[Glossary]. \

JS -> Javascript
{% endhint %}

## important characters in javascript

### ;   Semicolon

&#x20;JS does not strictly require them.  when there is a place where a semicolon is needed, the parser will add it behind the scenes. Code looks cleaner but be careful, it can produce some uncaught type errors.

### \[ ] Square brackets

Are mostly used to define arrays

```
["Violin","Viola","Violoncello"]
```

### {} curly brackets (the object 'creator')

In unix curly brackets are placeholders for output text. In the case of JS, they are used to pass **objects** to variables and functions. Also, they are used to combine a set of statements in a **block**:

```
{"a": 1, "b": 2}
```

### `<> Angle brackets or chevrons`

are used in UI Pages for HTML tags

```
<html>
<body>
<p>hello sound</p>
</body>
</html>
```
