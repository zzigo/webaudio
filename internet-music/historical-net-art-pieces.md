404 Page is a digital art piece that challenges the human-digital network relationship. Users visiting this website are greeted with a 404 message on a bright, solid-colored background. Typically, a 404 error message marks the end of a user's interactions with a website, but this 404 page marks the beginning of an engagement. [\[3\]](https://wiki.ubc.ca/404\_Page#cite\_note-3) Upon interaction with the website, the user is thrown into a continuous loop of different error pages. These various errors reflect the limitations of the digital network and the errors that are enfolded in the system.

* evokes loss or a missing gap which is a crucial part of the web and highlights how the system functions and malfunctions.
* the user and computer are stuck in a looping error where the user encounters a brightly colored screen with the error code "404".

Yotam Mann is a code-musician and the creator of tone.js. He works in webaudio since 2012

manifest:

> A sound that is alive, different every time and for every person. I believe interactivity gives listeners a deep engagement with music. I want to push music beyond the confines of the mp3, streaming service, and headphones. I want new music and new ways of listening.

This piece besides being totally created in ToneJS makes use of the scrolling method to mutate music parameters.

### 2020 Einklang freier wesen

[Einklang Freier Wesen](https://einklangfreierwesen.de)

Harmony (or Unison) of free beings

Five internationally renowned independent ensembles and the ZKM | Karlsruhe respond to the experience of the global pandemic by working together out of isolation. An interactive audio interface that enables an ensemble work by Georg Friedrich Haas to be experienced online.

(Ensembles Resonanz, Modern, Musikfabrik, Talea, Klangforum).

The digital audio interface makes it possible to embark on a journey of discovery through the work by giving the soloists voice, space, and sound inside the five ensembles, placing them in the digital space, and choosing the constellation. In this way, the interplay can be actively experienced, the musical experience interactive.

It not only explores which possibilities of music reception are created by new technologies and what these imply for analog music but also to what extent the society is generally a desirable utopia and whether digital space is an opportunity for the diversification of audiences and artists and aesthetic positions.

An Alternative web browser that turns web pages into digital confetti.

At a time when the web browser struggled against print metaphors like magazine and newspapter to find it’s own identity, The Shredder revealed the “soft” nature of the web. Markup, text, code, images and links are scattered across the screen like an instant Jackson Pollack. The raw material of the web, revealed, torn and tossed onto a heap.

### 2012, Jack Perconte, Anticipation
