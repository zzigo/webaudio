# HTML, CSS & JS

Due to the nature of this course, we will not go through each of these languages in detail. Rather, we will try to introduce the different concepts when we can directly apply them to musical thinking. However, here you will find essential information for coding simple applications.

Nevertheless, pay attention to this basic information, the concepts developed during the modules, and the integrations groups at the end of this book.

#### What is what?

#### &#x20;HTML

Is the system of tags originally created by Berners-Lee in 1991.  From the philosophical view, is a declarative language

### Basic structure

```
<html>
    <head>
    </head>
        <style>
            <!-- css code -->
    <body>
            <!-- html code -->
        <script>
            //javascript code
        </script>
    </body>
</html

```

Comments!\
****\
****Commenting on code is essential to document what the code does, especially in collaborative environments. When a line or block is "commented out" its content will be ignored by the browser.\


In most editors just select the text you want to comment on and press:

\
âŒ˜**+c  <- Universal shortcut for comments**

****\
**or manually:**

CSS ->  /\*  this is a comment  \*/\
HTML -> \<!-- this is a comment -- >\
JS ->      // this is a comment\
JS block -> /\*&#x20;

&#x20;                           this is a block comment

&#x20;                    \*/

&#x20;
