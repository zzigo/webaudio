# Introduction

Nick Collins, one of the makers and witnesses of the emergence of live coding within experimental music defines it this way:

* Art of re-programming; changing your mind about a process once established.
* For artistic purposes, often live performance; possible aspects of theatre, meta-composition.
* Used to be a bit controversial, now institutionalized?

&#x20;The practice of live coding spans several historical references. In the musical domain we can mention the Muskalisches Würfelspiel visited by C.P.E. Bach, Mozart, and to some extent also Tom Johnson, and of course John Cage. In terms of  Literature, practices ranging from text pieces (George Brecht's word events, LaMonte Young Composition 1960, Cornelius Cardew's School Time Special) to a clear quasi-predictive example imagined by Herman Hesse in[ "The Glass Bead Game"](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The\_Glass\_Bead\_Game).

The first programming languages to take this idea on board are Forth (1980, with which Ron Kuivila creates what is considered to be the first piece of live coding, 1985's "Water Surface"). \
Forth touches on some ideas from Lisp and Smalltalk, all that will later evolve into the first version of Supercollider.&#x20;
