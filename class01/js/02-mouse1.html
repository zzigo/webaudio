//02.01 we are using the element canvas. Canvas is used to draw graphics on a web page via Javascript. We will use it to track the mouse activity.

//define the Function
function onScreenConsole(event) {
	document.getElementById("console").innerHTML = "x =" + event.clientX + " y=" + event.clientY;
}




//02.02 here we use the getElementById() method of the document object

//02.03 To catch the mouse activity we are using an HTML DOM EVENT called onclick, but the problem is that there is not continuous information and we only know the mouse position on the click event.

// we don't need to run the Function as is triggered by the onclick Event on the canvas element.
// onScreenConsole();
