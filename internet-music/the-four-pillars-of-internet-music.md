# The four pillars of Internet Music

<summary>is adaptative</summary>

1. independence of platform and devices
2. variability of output.
   1. Until now the standard destination results in a Stereo output, basically speakers, or headphones.
   2. Through IOT in some future, or with Arduino bridges can feed also physical devices.
3. differential accessibility
   1. being a morphable instrument, it can vary its hermeticism or accessibility depending on the stage of apprentissage.
   2.  It can approach to the intuitive hapticity of the digital gadget. That is the common practice of people having used mobile gadgets for decades. In the words of Baudrillard: _an object that takes part of a universe of functional delirium, an eccentric technicism,  and gratuitous formalism, objects totally taken over by the imaginary, or obsessions pure and simple, functional aberrations_

       \[Baudrillard, 2012

<summary>is ubiquitous</summary>

1. its a web app , it doesn't need installation,  or specific coding for each device.
2. It can be replicated and updated in any number of devices, independently of branding, and design singularities. Standardization governs over branding. Over style?
3. its creates a **target environment**, where the composer-programmer can be anywhere and the instrument-destination be a speaker, a concert hall or a car.
