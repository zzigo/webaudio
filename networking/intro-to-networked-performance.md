# Intro to networked performance

Since few decades,  networked performance music can be considered as a bunch of innovative musical actions enabled by technology.

> A Networked Music Performance occurs when a group of musicians, located at different physical locations, interact over a network to perform as if they would, if located in the same room. (Lazzaro J & Wawzynel J ,2001)

On this historical definition, there is a bias that sees the network as a surrogate for the natural propagation of sound and light.&#x20;

Then, in order to establish certain typologies, we can arrive at a broader definition such as:

> the practice of conducting real-time music interaction over a computer network.&#x20;

In a very close interrelationship, technological limitations become aesthetic resources. For example the range of times stablished by LAN or WAN networks, from the tightly to the loosely synchronicity can be compared with the harmonic and articulation implications between an arpeggio and a chord.

This is inherent to the evolution of flow programming languages dedicated to music. In the case of MaxMSP where MIDI control (1987), an information in the RIA range (Realistic Interaction Approach) precedes the MSP (Max Signal Processing, 1990-1997), usually a signal in the LAA range (Latency Accepting Approach). In other words, latency becomes a musical parameter.
