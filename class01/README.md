# Introduction

Only 30 years have passed since the process of dematerialization, ubiquity and digitization started in 1991 right here in Geneva by Tim Berners-Lee.  Let us also remember that the primary impetus for the creation of the DARPA network (Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency, 1958) was fear, defense and the conquest of outer space. And a response to the launch of the Sputnik satellite by USSR (1957). Among the technologists and thinkers who designed the Internet, a series of common principles emerge that order the steps to follow:

1. On-going programs that seek to improve man-machine interaction in teaching and learning. (Joseph "Lick" Licklider, 1962)
2. The thinking of Paul Baran (1964), The distributed communications is the best system over the centralized and decentralized.
3. The need of the Standard Message Block: is a block that presents a common carrier communications network, by digital transmission, independent of its channel type (by the time, tv stations, satellites, variable data rate links and users), this will give rise to the concept of packet switching.

From a cognitive, linguistic and aesthetic point of view, there is a revolutionary shift between the emergence of the alphabet (-3500 AD) and the conformation of a synthetic-image language:

1. Mythical thought gives away to Historical Critical thinking because the structure of linear writing is a uni=dimensional, uni-directed line. So people started to think historically in a causal way, and in a critical way.
2. The emergence of internet language  gives away to a disruption into points, where discurse has been substituted by calculus or a systemic or structural way of thinking.
    1. MM LANGUAGE (PREHISTORIC WAY OF THINKING) → ALPHABET (HISTORICAL CONSCIOUSNESS) → INTERNET (POST-HISTORICAL STRUCTURAL WAY OF THINKING).
        1. In the greek-jewish traditional framework where images are being accepted with distrust or only as a copy of the realm, internet introduces a protocol where images no long represent the world , but are articulations of thoughts. They are models, projections, or resonant signs (a sign with the McLuhman's tetradic function).

### how can we interpret the internet today?

- As a high complex artificial being with a mostly unknown nature.
- A task of our age is to use, shape and discover (interpret and create) the internet.
- '60→ interconnected universities '80→world connected '90 www '00 → social network '10 → IOT
- 1995 mp3, 2000 peer-to-peer technologies, 2005  streaming, 2008 blockchain.
- on the second decade of XXI century Internet can be understood as a complex being formed from five kinds of interwined coexisting networks: the net, the web, the social networks, the IoT, and the sharing networks.
- Identifying shaping influences of certain social and cultural relationships on the formation of the internet makes it easier for us to consider and identify the opposite relationships (i.e. to study the social and cultural impacts of internet use)
- Understanding the social construction of the internet can help us understand the social and cultural impact of its use. *(The social construction of technology: SCOT, proposed by Bijker and Pinch ( The Social Constructions of Facts and Artefacts: Or How the Sociology of Science and the Sociology of Technology Might Benefit Each Other).*
- Some characteristics:
    - The mode of Internet use changes very quickly and in an unpredictable way.
        - Internet is ubiquitous or omnipresent. This makes almost impossible to define Internet as a research object , due its highly complex organization of complex entities. *(Barabasi, Linked: The New Science of Networks; Pastor-Satorras and Vespignani, Evolution and Structure of the Internet)*
    - The users of internet are not passive acceptors , but they are active agents. *(Feenberg and Freisen, (Re) Inventing the Internet, and the so-called " user research", Oudshoorn and Pinch, How Users Maters. I*n other words, constructor and user roles typically interlock with each other.
    - The emergence and deployment of the internet is synchronyc with the late modern or postmodern age in a parallel trajectory with becoming widespread and achieving a cultural dominancy of the postmodern values and ideology.
    - ubiquity across devices and operating systems.
    - user-centered security model, and the fact that neither its specification nor its implementation is controlled by a single company makes the web a unique platform to develop software on.
    - inherent linkability, it's possible to search it and share what you've found with anyone, anywhere.

one  historical and two extreme examples.

### 1994, Jodi, personal website

[%Location | http://wwwwwwwww.jodi.org](http://wwwwwwwww.jodi.org/)

### [1995 Jodi, 404](http://404.jodi.org/)

Jodi is a collective (Joan Heemskerk and Dirk Paesmans) based in Londond active since 1994.

404 Page is a digital art piece that challenges the human-digital network relationship. Users visiting this website are greeted with a 404 message on a bright, solid coloured background. Typically, a 404 error message marks the end of a user's interactions with a website, but this 404 page marks the beginning of an engagement. [[3]](https://wiki.ubc.ca/404_Page#cite_note-3) Upon interaction with the website, the user is thrown into a continuous loop of different error pages. These various errors reflect the limitations of the digital network and the errors that are enfolded in the system.

- evokes loss or a missing gap which is a crucial part of the
web and highlights the ways in which the system functions and
malfunctions.
- the user and computer are stuck in a looping error where the user encounters a brightly colored screen with error code "404".
- spectators see something that is meant to inform them that there is nothing there.
- It creates a breach between the intended conventions of the web and the ways spectators read these representations.

### 2016, Yotam Mann, [Jazz.Computer](http://jazz.computer/)

Yotam Mann is a code-musician and the creator of tone.js. He works in webaudio since 2012

manifest:

> Sound that is alive, different every time and for every person. I believe interactivity gives listeners a deep engagement with music. I want to push music beyond the confines of the mp3, streaming service and headphones. I want new music and new ways of listening.

### 2020 ZKM,  [Einklang freier wesen](https://einklangfreierwesen.de/)

Harmony (or Unison) of free beings

Five internationally renowned independent ensembles and the ZKM | Karlsruhe respond to the experience of the global pandemic by working together out of isolation. An interactive audio interface that enables an ensemble work by Georg Friedrich Haas to be experienced online.

(Ensembles Resonanz, Modern, Musikfabrok, Talea, Klangforum).

The digital audio interface makes it possible to embark on a journey of discovery through the work by giving the soloists voice, space and sound inside the five ensembles, placing them in the digital space and choosing the constellation. In this way, the interplay can be actively experienced, the musical experience interactive.

It not only explores which possibilities of music reception are created by new technologies and what these imply for analog music, but also to what extent tele-society is generally a desirable utopia and whether digital space is an opportunity for the diversification of audiences and artists and aesthetic positions.

**App Design and Realization**

21st digital (Steffen Rüther, Andres Stennert)

## 01.1 The principles of Internet Music

- **Is adaptative**
    1. independence of platform and devices
    2. variability of output. 
        1. Until now the standard destination results in a ST output, basically speakers, or headphones. 
        2. Througn IOT in some future, or with arduino bridges can feed also physical devices. 
    3. differential accessibility
        1. being a morphable instrument, it can vary its hermeticism or accessibility depending on the stage of apprentissage.
        2. It can approach to the intuitive hapticity of the digital gadget. That is the common practice of people having used the mobile gadgets for decades. In words of Baudrillard: *an object that takes part of a universe of functional delirium, an eccentric technicism and gratuitous formalism, objects totally taken over by the imaginary, or obsessions pure and simple, functional aberrations*
        
              [Baudrillard, 2012]
        
- **is ubiquitous**
    1. its a webapp , it doesn't need installation, or specific coding for each device.
    2. It can be replicated and updated in any number of devices, independenly of branding , and design singularities. Standarization governs over branding. Over style?
    3. its creates a **target enviroment**, where the composer-programmer can be anyware and the instrument-destination be a speaker, a concert-hall or a car.
- **can be networked.**
    1. Morphology and content can be depend on networking activity.
        1. remoticity
        2. colective peformance & audience participation
        3. data art
        4. chat-bots
        5. interactive soundscape
        6. livecoding and freeimpro enviroments
    2. Allows cognitive and distribute performances.
    3. I can produce exo instruments incorporating any type of js devices.
- **Is extensible**
    1. Access to big data
    2. Potentially infinite extensibility through API's
    
    **AI buffer generation**
    

## 01.2 Webmusic is a case of  Generative music

### What does listening to Generative Music mean?

1. First hypothesis: we don't know what is internet generative music because the most important pieces already didn't happen.
2. Generative Music can be only produce by means of free software.
3. On the times of Illiac Suite (Hiller and Issacson) the mediation of the music to be listen included a recording or an orchestra. Is not essencially generative.
    1. Generation and sound realization are synchronic.
    2. So Instantiation of Generative Music can be realted to the computational powers of each age.

## The destination: Living in a pre tangible internet era.

### Tangibility: IOTT

With the rise of new media and digital art,there are many different trends to
bring the conversation of art and technology back to the body. Works that advocate for involve the body on a deeper level and invoke our
senses, playful and engaging;  interacting  with us.

Other "destination" latent posibilities

# 1.1 Javascript

## variables

1. Variables in JS are untype

```jsx
// Values can be assigned to variables with an = sign 

x = 0; // Now the variable x has the value 0
x.  // => 0: A variable evaluates to its value

// JavaScript supports several types of values 

x = 1; // Numbers.
x = 0.01; // Numbers can be integers or reals.
x = "hello world"; // Strings of text in quotation marks.
x = 'JavaScript'; // Single quote marks also delimit strings.
x = true; // A Boolean value.
x = false; // The other Boolean value.
x = null; // Null is a special value that means "no value."
x = undefined; // Undefined is another special value like null. 
```

Since the update ES6 (2015) there are new features to declare variables. Basically, we have the new options `let` and `const`, added to the old `var`

Each of its specificities will be defined by their scope, use and hoisting. 

### One Statement, Many Variables

You can declare many variables in one statement.

```jsx
var person = "John Doe", carName = "Volvo", price = 200;
```

### var

What is a scope? 

Scope means where these variables are available for use. **var** declarations area globally scoped or function/locally scoped. 

- global: when a **var** is declared outside a function. So, when a var is declared outside a function (or a block) is available for use in the whole window.

```jsx
var tonality = "C Major" ;

function section1() {
	var modulation = "Eb Major";
}
```

Here, `tonality` is globally scoped because it exits outside a function while `modulation` is function scoped. So we cannot access the variable `modulation`  outside of a function .

- var variables can be re-declared and updated
    
    ```jsx
    var tonality = "C Major";
    var tonality = "Gb Major";
    
    or
    
    var tonality = "C Major";
    tonality = "Gb Major";
    ```
    

### Hoisting

Is a JavaScript mechanism where variables and functions declarations are moved to the top o their scope before code execution. This mean tjat if we do this:

```jsx
console.log (tonality);
var tonality = "C Major"; 
```

it is interpreted as this:

```jsx
var tonality;
console.log (tonality); // still undefined
tonality = "C Major";
```

### let

Variables defined with `let` cannot be Redeclared.

Variables defined with `let` must be Declared before use.

Variables defined with `let` have Block Scope.

Is now preferred for variable declaration. Its an improvement to `var` declarations and solve many problems. 

- `let` is block scoped
    - A block is a chunk of code bounded by {} . A block lives in curly braces: function, for, while, if..then..else, switch case, arrays.
    - A variable declared in a block with `let` is only available for use tithin that block.
    
    ```jsx
    let greeting = "say Hi";
       let times = 4;
    
       if (times > 3) {
            let hello = "say Hello instead";
            console.log(hello);// "say Hello instead"
        }
       console.log(hello) // hello is not defined
    ```
    

We see that using `hello` outside its block (the curly braces where it was defined) returns an error. This is because `let` variables are block scoped .

**let can be updated but not re-declared.**

Just like `var`, a variable declared with `let` can be updated within its scope. Unlike `var`, a `let` variable cannot be re-declared within its scope. So while this will work:

```jsx
let greeting = "say Hi";
    greeting = "say Hello instead";
```

this will return an error:

```jsx
let greeting = "say Hi";
    let greeting = "say Hello instead"; // error: Identifier 'greeting' has already been declared
```

### const

Variables defined with `const` cannot be Redeclared.

Variables defined with `const` cannot be Reassigned.

Variables defined with `const` have Block Scope.

```jsx
const PI = 3.141592653589793;
PI = 3.14;      // This will give an error
PI = PI + 10;   // This will also give an error
```

Variables declared with the `const` maintain constant values. `const` declarations share some similarities with `let` declarations.

- **const declarations are block scoped**
    
    Like `let` declarations, `const` declarations can only be accessed within the block they were declared.
    
- **const cannot be updated or re-declared**
    
    This means that the value of a variable declared with `const` remains the same within its scope. It cannot be updated or re-declared. So if we declare a variable with `const`, we can neither do this:
    
    ```jsx
        const greeting = "say Hi";
        greeting = "say Hello instead";// error: Assignment to constant variable.
    
    ```
    
    nor this:
    
    ```jsx
        const greeting = "say Hi";
        const greeting = "say Hello instead";// error: Identifier 'gre
    ```
    
    Every `const` declaration, therefore, must be initialized at the time of declaration.
    
    This behavior is somehow different when it comes to objects declared with `const`. While a `const` object cannot be updated, the properties of this objects can be updated. Therefore, if we declare a `const` object as this:
    
    ```jsx
        const greeting = {
            message: "say Hi",
            times: 4
        }
    
    ```
    
    while we cannot do this:
    
    ```jsx
        greeting = {
            words: "Hello",
            number: "five"
        } // error:  Assignment to constant variable.
    
    ```
    
    we can do this:
    
    ```jsx
        greeting.message = "say Hello instead";
    
    ```
    
    This will update the value of `greeting.message` without returning errors.
    

### **Hoisting of const**

- Just like `let`, `const` declarations are hoisted to the top but are not initialized.
- So just in case you missed the differences, here they are:
- `varletconstvarletconst`They are all hoisted to the top of their scope. But while variables are initialized with , and variables are not initialized.While and can be declared without being initialized, must be initialized during declaration.

## Operators

JavaScript includes operators same as other languages. An operator
performs some operation on single or multiple operands (data value) and
produces a result.

```jsx
3 + 2 // => 5: addition 
3 - 2 // => 1: subtraction 
3 * 2 // => 6: multiplication 
3 / 2 // => 1.5: division 
points[1].x - points[0].x // => 1: more complicated operands also work 
"3" + "2" // => "32": + adds numbers, concatenates strings

// JavaScript defines some shorthand arithmetic operators 
let count = 0; // Define a variable 
count++; // Increment the variable 
count--; // Decrement the variable 
count += 2; // Add by 2 
count *= 3; // Multiply by 3: same as count = count * 3; 
count // => 6: variable names are expressions, too.
```

```jsx
// unequal, less than, greater than, and so on. They evaluate to true or false. 
let x = 2, y = 3; // These = signs are assignment, not equality tests 
x === y // => false: equality
x !== y. // => true inequality
x < y // => true: less-than 
x <= y // => true: less-than or equal 
x > y // => false: greater-than 
x >= y // => false: greater-than or equal 
"two" === "three" // => false: the two strings are different 
"two" > "three" // => true: "tw" is alphabetically greater than "th" 
false === (x > y) // => true: false is equal to false

// Logical operators combine or invert boolean values 
(x === 2) && (y === 3) // => true: both comparisons are true. && is AND 
(x > 3) || (y < 3) // => false: neither comparison is true. || is OR 
!(x === y). // => true: ! inverts a boolean value

//Logical operators 
Lexpr ?? Rlxpr // Nullish coalescing operator , returns its right=hand 
								//side operand when its left-hand side operand 
								//is null otherwise returns its left-hand operand.

option.duration ??=100//logical nullish assignment its used for example to mark default values if null

								
```

# Classes

[How to define a class ](https://www.notion.so/How-to-define-a-class-9724b401cd2b440f9b32873ebd3a7a04)

[3 ways to define a JavaScript class](https://www.phpied.com/3-ways-to-define-a-javascript-class/)

### Function hello world

A function in JavaScript is similar to a procedure—**a set of statements that performs a task or calculates a value**, but for a procedure to qualify as a function, it should take some input and return an output where there is some obvious relationship between
the input and the output.

It's important to note that there are no classes in JavaScript. Functions can be used to somewhat simulate classes, but in general
JavaScript is a class-less language. Everything is an object. And when it comes to inheritance, objects inherit from objects, not classes from classes as in the "class"-ical languages.

```jsx
function effectsBox(input) {

    return input * 2;

}

console.log(effectsBox(120)); // Output 240

//_____________________________________

function effectsBox(input, multiplier) {

    return input * multiplier;
}

console.log(effectsBox(120, 2)); // Output 240

//________________________________________

var add = function(a, b) {
    return a + b;
};

var container = add(2, 3);
console.log(container); // 5
```

### instances

```jsx
var audioContext = new AudioContext(); //___Initializes web audio api

function playOsc(oscType, freq) {
    var osc = audioContext.createOscillator();
    osc.type = oscType;
    osc.frequency.value = freq; //____freq is a parameter
    osc.connect(audioContext.destination);
    osc.start(audioContext.currentTime);
}

playOsc("sine", 330); //____Plays oscillator at 330hz

/*____We can play multiple oscillators at once using only
one line of code each time! Adding another sine at 340 will
create a pulsating effect*/

playOsc("sine", 340);
```

```jsx
var audioContext = new AudioContext();
//___________________________________BEGIN Custom sound
function customSound(filterVal) {
    var osc_1 = audioContext.createOscillator();
    var osc_2 = audioContext.createOscillator();
    var filter = audioContext.createBiquadFilter();
    filter.type = "lowpass";
    osc_1.type = "sawtooth";
    osc_1.frequency.value = 300;
    osc_2.type = "sawtooth";
    osc_2.frequency.value = 402;
    filter.frequency.value = filterVal || filter.frequency.value;
    osc_1.connect(filter);
    osc_2.connect(filter);
    filter.connect(audioContext.destination);
    osc_1.start(audioContext.currentTime);
    osc_2.start(audioContext.currentTime);
}
//___________________________________END Custom sound

//___________________________________BEGIN square wave
function square(filterVal) {
    var osc = audioContext.createOscillator();
    var filter = audioContext.createBiquadFilter();
    filter.type = "lowpass";
    osc.type = "square";
    osc.frequency.value = 100;
    filter.frequency.value = filterVal || filter.frequency.value;
    osc.connect(filter);
    filter.connect(audioContext.destination);
    osc.start(audioContext.currentTime);
}

//___________________________________END square wave

//___________________________________BEGIN effectsBox

function effectsBox(sourceInput, filterParam) {

    sourceInput(filterParam);
}
//___________________________________END effectsBox

effectsBox(customSound, 80); // Example
```

### Arguments

```jsx
function playOsc(oscType, freq) {
    console.log(arguments[0]);
    console.log(arguments[1]);
}
playOsc("sine", 200); // sine 200
```

### Throw

```jsx
function playOsc(oscType, freq) {
    if (arguments.length !== 2) {
        throw "Error! This function takes two arguments ";
    }
}

playOsc("sine"); //___Error! This function takes two arguments

//
function playOsc(oscType, freq) {
    if (arguments.length !== 2) {
        throw "Error! This function takes two arguments";
    }
    //_____Check for correct argument data types
    if (typeof oscType !== "string" || typeof freq !== "number") {
        throw "Please enter the correct argument types";
    }
}
playOsc(100, true); //___Please enter the correct argument types
```

### callback

```jsx
"use strict";

function doStuff(callback) {
    return callback();
}

function addTwoNumbers() {
    return 2 + 2;
}
doStuff(addTwoNumbers); // 4

//_________________________________________
"use strict";

function doStuff(callback) {

    return callback();

}

doStuff(function() { //___Callback declaration is used directly

    return 3 + 3;

});

//______________________________________________

"use strict";

function calculateFrequencies(a, b, callback) {
    if (callback === undefined) {
        return a * b;
    } else {
        return callback(a, b);
    }
}

function diff(a, b) {
    return Math.abs(a - b);
}

console.log(calculateFrequencies(200, 2)); // 400___Multiplies numbers
console.log(calculateFrequencies(1000, 4000, diff)); // 3000___uses custom callback to find the difference
```

### Types of functions and function scoping

1. Anonymous functions

```jsx
// When used as a function expression
(function () {});
// or using the ECMAScript 2015 arrow notation
() => {};
```

1. named functions
    
    ```jsx
    // Function declaration
    function foo() {};
    // Named function expression
    (function bar() {});
    // or using the ECMAScript 2015 arrow notation
    const foo = () => {};
    ```
    
2. inner outer functions
    
    ```jsx
    function addSquares(a,b) {
       function square(x) {
          return x * x;
       }
       return square(a) + square(b);
    };
    //Using ECMAScript 2015 arrow notation
    const addSquares = (a,b) => {
       const square = x => x*x;
       return square(a) + square(b);
    };
    ```
    
3. IIFE [immediately invoked function expression]
    1. is a js function that runs as soon as it is defined.
        1. 
        
        ```jsx
        (function () {
          statements
        })();
        ```
        
4. arrow function expression
    
    An arrow function expression is a compact alternative to a traditional function expression, but is limited and can't be used in all situations.
