### Static mouse position

We are using the element canvas. Canvas is used to draw graphics on a web page via Javascript. We will use it to track the mouse activity. To know more about it, go to [Canvas](../html/canvas.md).\


To catch the mouse activity we are using an **HTML DOM event** called _onclick_, but the problem is that there is no continuous information and we only know the mouse position on the click event.
