# IM: a case of Generative Music

What does listening to Generative Music mean?

1. First hypothesis: we don't know what is internet generative music because the most important pieces already didn't happen.
2. Generative Music can be only produced by means of free software.
3. In the times of Illiac Suite (Hiller and Issacson) the mediation of the music to listen included a recording or an orchestra. Is not essentially generative.
   1. Generation and sound realization are synchronic.
   2. So Instantiation of Generative Music can be related to the computational powers of each age.

## Introduction: Procedural Music

The process of mechanization as “Automatic programming{ (Kyong Chun 2011, 41). It contributes both to a certain deskilling but also to the forming of craftsmanship where “ through automation, expertise is both created and called into question”.

Creative intentions take shape during the activity of sound production and not only prior to it. By focusing on the operational as ‘on-going; the aim here is to explore conditions where one continuously engages with generative sound processes and how they are constructed.

Work processes, composed in detail, are let to each other, and these relationships come into evidence at the surface of the sounds. Each sound is therefore not a blotch of colors but itself a form, as it owes its existence to a formal construction, to a form process; (Koening 1965, 8).

Methods as emerging from the application, “figured within design and engineering discourses precisely not as already existing and independently agential, but as emerging from and dependent upon the actions of their (human) makers. (Suchman 2012, 55).

The ephemeral nature of software, the distinction between system conception and realization, and the difference between “software as product and software as a process: (Fabretti 2015,104). where “writing, experimentation, “working out” are essential disciplines for the theoretician”&#x20;

## Spatial and Procedural early examples

### La Monte Young, Trio for Strings (1958)

![Trio for Strings (1958), La Monte Young](<../.gitbook/assets/image (1) (1).png>)

\[from [**Following a Straight Line: La Monte Young**](http://www.users.waitrose.com/\~chobbs/smithyoung.html#\_edn11)**, by Dave Smith]**

Is based entirely on different spacings and transpositions of selected pitches (usually three at any one time) from the 'dream chord'. The opening is given in Example 1. “ My timings are approximate since they are taken down from a recording, but the overlapping of notes in time seems to be carefully structured throughout the work as does the order of pitches (which is related to twelve-note procedures). But these are incidental aspects. What is more noticeable is that the 48-minute _Trio_ is played entirely without vibrato, mostly pretty quietly and with very slow bowing. The sculptural qualities of the sound are reinforced in performance by the statuesque appearance of the players. The timbres are devoid of colour and the notes are played not 'as individual "parts" but as contributions to a chordal unit whose components are of different durations'.[\[11\]](http://www.users.waitrose.com/\~chobbs/smithyoung.html#\_edn11) These chordal units are separated by silences lasting up to 40 seconds.

### La Monte Young, _Drift Studies_ (1964- )

For two or more ultra-stable, precisely-tuned sine-wave drones. The recorded version offers a whole range of psychoacoustical effects to the armchair listener. In time, however, the pitches will 'drift' slightly, despite the accuracy of the equipment. Among other things this causes the volume of each pitch to drift as well. Between September 1966 and January 1970 Young had turned his house into a continuous sound environment. He consequently studied the effects in great detail.

### Alvin Lucier, Crossing, (1982)

![](<../.gitbook/assets/image (1) (1) (1).png>)

Crossings(1982), for small orchestra, with slow sweep pure wave oscillator, page 1 of the manuscript score. The diagonal line represents a slowly ascending sine wave sweeping from C at 32.7 cycles per second to F-sharp at 92.5 cycles per second. Whole notes straddling the diagonal denote long tones played by various instruments. Those on the left and right of the diagonal denote the left and right sides of the loudspeaker from which the rising wave flows. Numbers to the left and right of the diagonal are cues in cycles per second for the players to begin and end their sustained tones.
